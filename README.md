Included are two index files. One is a .html file, and the other is a .php. ONLY UPLOAD ONE! The .php is a copy of the .html with a contact form.

## Adding new games
In the html/php, find the section for games. This site is using getskeleton.com as a CSS framework. You'll see a class name called "six columns". The total is 12, so when you add or remove entries by copying the sections, change the class name to the appropriate one, e.g. "four columns" when there are three entries. 

## Contact form
At the top of the php file there's a $recipient variable. Change that to the email address you want mail sent to. There's no real protection on this form; it's pretty bare bones. I'd advise not using your personal one just in case.
